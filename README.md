# (WIP) Color Thief in Rust

This is a work in progress, and is not yet functional.

A Rust rewrite of `color-thief-py`. Color Thief generates a color palette using the colors in a provided image. This repository is a Rust port of Shipeng Feng's [Color Thief](https://github.com/fengsp/color-thief-py)
